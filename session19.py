'''1
Define a Python class called Song with attributes title, artist, and duration (in seconds),
 and use the __init__() constructor to initialize these values when creating an object.
2.
Create an object of the Song class for your favorite track from Spotify, 
and print out its title and artist using object attributes.
3.
Add a method play_preview(self) to your Song class that prints 
'Playing 30-second preview of [title] by [artist]'. Call this method for your Song object.
4.
Create a class called FoodOrder with attributes restaurant_name, items (a list),
 and total_price. Add a method add_item(self, item, price) that adds the item to the items
   list and updates total_price. Demonstrate by creating a FoodOrder object and adding 
   two items like you would on Zomato.
5.
Refactor your Song class so that it also tracks a play_count attribute (starting at 0),
 and add a method increment_play_count(self) that increases play_count by 1 each time it's called.
   Show how you would use this to count how many times a user plays a song.
   <br><br><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Call increment_play_count() multiple times and print 
   play_count to see the update.</em>'''''
